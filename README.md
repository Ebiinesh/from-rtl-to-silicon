# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!

This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks organized inside each week folder.

> In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
> This is part of Indiaâ€™s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nationâ€™s semiconductor ecosystem.

## ðŸ“… Week 0 â€” Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Task 1](./Week0/task1.md) | Create GitHub repo and document summary of the previous video | âœ… Completed |
| [Task 2](./Week0/task2.md) | Install listed tools using the machine configuration and update repo with tool snapshots | âœ… Completed |

### ðŸŒŸ Key Learnings from Week 0

- Successfully installed and verified open-source EDA tools such as Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkwave.
- Learned basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
- Prepared the system for upcoming RTL to GDSII flow experiments.
